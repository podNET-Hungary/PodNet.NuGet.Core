# How to Become a Sponsor

Although we do our open source work to show our appreciation and give back to the community through creation, you can show your support via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/podNET-Hungary), [Patreon](https://patreon.com/podNETHungary), or by taking a look at our courses (currently in Hungarian) on [our website](https://podnet.hu/).

Becoming a GitHub Sponsor or Patreon Patron bring various benefits, like access to our Sponsors' Exclusive Area on GitHub, shoutout in our published videos, blog posts or even a shoutout at and VIP tickets to our next meetup, or you can ask questions we'll answer in the podcasts! Not to mention our unending gratitude. 🙏
